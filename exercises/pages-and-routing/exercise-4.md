## Exercise 4

Currently, we have a bunch of pages but no way to navigate between them. Letâ€™s hook everything up using the Link component!

- The button on the landing page should go to the catalog page

- Each item in the grid on the catalog page should go to the details page

- The button on the catch all page should go to the catalog page

Once completed, run `npm run dev`, and go to the landing page. You should be able to navigate to the catalog and each product. Additionally, if you re-visit the path from the last exercise, you should be able to return to the catalog.
